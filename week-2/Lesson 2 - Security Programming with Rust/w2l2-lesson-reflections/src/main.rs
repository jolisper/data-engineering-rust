//! Reflection Questions:
//! 
//! # How could you improve security for a high availability system?
//!
//! Improving security for a high availability system involves multiple layers of
//! defense to ensure that the system can resist various attack vectors while
//! remaining available. Here are some strategies:
//!
//! - **Redundancy**: Implement redundant systems and failover mechanisms to
//!   handle hardware or software failures without downtime.
//!
//! - **Regular Updates**: Keep all components updated with the latest security
//!   patches to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
//!
//! - **Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems**: Deploy firewalls and IDS to
//!   monitor and filter out malicious traffic.
//!
//! - **Load Balancers**: Use load balancers to evenly distribute traffic and
//!   prevent Denial of Service (DoS) attacks from overwhelming a single point.
//!
//! - **Security Audits**: Conduct regular security audits to identify and
//!   remediate potential weaknesses.
//!
//! - **Access Controls**: Enforce strict access controls and authentication
//!   mechanisms to limit access to sensitive systems and data.
//!
//! - **Encryption**: Use encryption for data at rest and in transit to protect
//!   against data breaches and eavesdropping.
//!
//! - **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging
//!   to detect and respond to security incidents quickly.
//!
//! - **Disaster Recovery Plan**: Have a robust disaster recovery plan in place
//!   to restore operations quickly after a security incident.
//!
//! - **Employee Training**: Educate employees on security best practices and
//!   potential social engineering attacks.
//!
//! - **DDoS Protection Services**: Employ DDoS protection services to mitigate
//!   the impact of large-scale attacks.
//!
//! By integrating these practices, a high availability system can be fortified
//! against a range of security threats while maintaining continuous operation.
//! 
//! # What are some differences between classical vs modern encryption?
//!
//! Classical and modern encryption differ in various ways, from the complexity
//! of their algorithms to the level of security they provide. Here are some key
//! differences:
//!
//! - **Algorithm Complexity**: Classical encryption often uses simpler
//!   algorithms like substitution ciphers, while modern encryption uses complex
//!   mathematical algorithms such as AES and RSA.
//!
//! - **Key Length**: Modern encryption uses much longer keys, providing a higher
//!   level of security against brute force attacks compared to the shorter keys
//!   of classical encryption.
//!
//! - **Computational Power**: Modern encryption is designed to be secure even
//!   against attackers with significant computational power, which was not a
//!   concern for classical encryption.
//!
//! - **Purpose**: Classical encryption was primarily for confidentiality in
//!   written communication, while modern encryption also ensures integrity,
//!   authentication, and non-repudiation in digital communications.
//!
//! - **Symmetric vs Asymmetric**: Classical encryption typically involves
//!   symmetric key algorithms, where the same key is used for both encryption
//!   and decryption. Modern encryption includes both symmetric and asymmetric
//!   algorithms, the latter using a public key for encryption and a private key
//!   for decryption.
//!
//! - **Cryptanalysis Resistance**: Modern encryption is designed to resist
//!   sophisticated cryptanalysis techniques, whereas classical encryption can
//!   often be broken with basic frequency analysis.
//!
//! - **Standardization**: Modern encryption methods are standardized and
//!   scrutinized by the cryptographic community, unlike the proprietary or
//!   ad-hoc methods of classical encryption.
//!
//! - **Applications**: While classical encryption was used for messages and
//!   relatively small amounts of data, modern encryption secures everything from
//!   online transactions to entire databases and communication systems.
//!
//! The evolution from classical to modern encryption reflects the advancements
//! in mathematics, computer science, and our understanding of cryptography.
//! 
//! # What Rust capabilities help prevent software vulnerabilities?
//!
//! Rust offers several capabilities designed to prevent common software
//! vulnerabilities, enhancing security and safety. These include:
//!
//! - **Ownership and Borrowing**: Rust's ownership system, along with rules for
//!   borrowing, prevents dangling pointers and data races at compile time.
//!
//! - **Lifetime Management**: Lifetimes ensure that references do not outlive
//!   the data they point to, preventing use-after-free errors.
//!
//! - **Type Safety**: Rust's strong type system helps catch bugs at compile
//!   time that might otherwise lead to vulnerabilities.
//!
//! - **Memory Safety**: Rust guarantees memory safety by ensuring that all
//!   accesses are valid and preventing buffer overflows without needing a
//!   garbage collector.
//!
//! - **Concurrency Safety**: The language's concurrency model prevents data
//!   races, a common source of errors in concurrent programming.
//!
//! - **Minimal Runtime**: Rust's minimal runtime and lack of a garbage collector
//!   reduce the attack surface of applications.
//!
//! - **Error Handling**: Rust's `Result` and `Option` types encourage explicit
//!   handling of error cases, avoiding silent failures.
//!
//! - **Macro System**: Rust's macros reduce the risk of code injection attacks
//!   by performing code generation at compile time with strict syntax and type
//!   checking.
//!
//! - **Immutable by Default**: Variables in Rust are immutable by default,
//!   reducing the chances of side effects and unintended changes to data.
//!
//! - **Pattern Matching**: Rust's pattern matching helps in exhaustive checks,
//!   ensuring that all possible values are handled, which prevents bugs related
//!   to unhandled cases.
//!
//! - **No Null**: Rust does not have null values, eliminating null pointer
//!   dereferences, which are a common vulnerability in other languages.
//!
//! These features contribute to Rust's ability to deliver more secure software
//! by mitigating many of the common sources of vulnerabilities found in other
//! programming languages.
//! 
//! # What best practices should be used for crypto in Rust?
//!
//! Implementing cryptographic solutions in Rust should be guided by best
//! practices to ensure the highest levels of security:
//!
//! - **Use Established Libraries**: Opt for well-maintained cryptographic
//!   libraries that are widely used and have been security audited, such as
//!   *ring*, *sodiumoxide*, or *rust-crypto*.
//!
//! - **Keep Libraries Updated**: Stay current with the latest versions of
//!   cryptographic libraries to benefit from security patches and
//!   improvements, protecting against newly discovered vulnerabilities.
//!
//! - **Avoid Rolling Your Own Crypto**: Custom cryptographic implementations
//!   are prone to errors. Rely on established libraries that have been tested
//!   and reviewed by security experts.
//!
//! - **Secure Key Management**: Use secure methods and tools like hardware
//!   security modules (HSMs) or operating system key stores to protect and
//!   manage cryptographic keys.
//!
//! - **Use Strong Algorithms and Keys**: Select algorithms and key lengths
//!   that comply with current security standards to withstand future
//!   cryptanalytic advancements.
//!
//! - **Test for Side-Channel Attacks**: Protect against side-channel attacks
//!   that could compromise secret data through indirect means such as timing,
//!   power consumption, electromagnetic, or acoustic analysis. Ensure that
//!   the cryptographic implementation does not inadvertently leak information
//!   through these channels. This can involve constant-time processing for
//!   cryptographic algorithms, avoiding branch conditions based on secret
//!   values, and careful memory management.
//!
//! - **Secure Random Number Generation**: Use cryptographically secure
//!   pseudo-random number generators (CSPRNGs) for generating keys, nonces,
//!   and other random components in cryptographic operations to prevent
//!   predictability and ensure randomness.
//!
//! - **Follow Cryptographic Best Practices**: Implement protocols with correct
//!   use of initialization vectors (IVs), salts, padding schemes, and other
//!   cryptographic constructs to maintain security.
//!
//! - **Perform Security Audits**: Have cryptographic implementations reviewed
//!   by experienced security professionals to identify and rectify potential
//!   weaknesses.
//!
//! - **Monitor for Cryptographic Breakthroughs**: Keep abreast of the latest
//!   developments in cryptographic research to anticipate and respond to new
//!   threats and advancements in the field.
//!
//! Adhering to these best practices helps Rust developers leverage the language's
//! inherent safety features while ensuring that their cryptographic code remains
//! secure against a wide range of potential attacks, including those that exploit
//! subtle side-channel vulnerabilities.
