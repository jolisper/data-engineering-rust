//! Reflection Questions:
//! 
//! # How does Mutex help in safely sharing the fork between philosophers?
//!
//! In the context of the dining philosophers problem, a `Mutex` is used to ensure
//! safe sharing of forks between philosophers (threads) to avoid race conditions 
//! and ensure that no two philosophers can hold the same fork at the same time.
//!
//! Here's how `Mutex` contributes to thread safety:
//!
//! - **Exclusive Access**: The `Mutex` (mutual exclusion) primitive ensures that 
//!   only one philosopher at a time can hold a `lock` on a fork. When a 
//!   philosopher tries to pick up a fork, they must acquire the `lock`. If the 
//!   `lock` is already held by another philosopher, the current philosopher must 
//!   wait until the fork is available (i.e., the `lock` is released).
//!
//! - **Prevention of Data Races**: By using a `Mutex`, we ensure that the state 
//!   of the fork (whether it is being used or not) cannot be accessed by multiple 
//!   philosophers concurrently, thus preventing data races.
//!
//! - **Deadlock Avoidance**: In the dining philosophers problem, strategies such 
//!   as acquiring forks in a particular order (e.g., lower-numbered forks first) 
//!   can prevent deadlocks, where two or more philosophers hold one fork each and 
//!   wait indefinitely for the other. The `Mutex` alone does not prevent 
//!   deadlocks, but it is used as part of the strategy to do so.
//!
//! - **Atomicity**: `Mutex` provides atomicity for the operations of acquiring 
//!   and releasing the fork. When a philosopher finishes eating, they release 
//!   both forks at once, ensuring that atomicity is maintained.
//!
//! In summary, `Mutex` helps maintain the integrity of shared resources in 
//! concurrent programming by ensuring that only one thread can access the 
//! resource at a time, thus providing a foundation for building safe and 
//! deadlock-free concurrent applications.
//! 
//! # How is deadlock avoided in this example?
//!
//! Deadlock is avoided in this implementation of the dining philosophers problem
//! by employing a strategy that prevents all four conditions required for a
//! deadlock from occurring simultaneously. The four conditions are mutual
//! exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, and circular wait.
//!
//! The key technique used to avoid deadlock in this example is:
//!
//! - **Even/Odd Ordering**: To prevent a situation where all philosophers pick up
//!   one fork and then wait for the other (which would lead to deadlock), the
//!   philosophers are divided into two groups based on their ID (even or odd).
//!   Even-numbered philosophers pick up the left fork first, and odd-numbered
//!   ones pick up the right fork first. This further reduces the chance of
//!   entering a circular wait state.
//!
//! These approaches, in combination with the use of `Mutex` to ensure exclusive
//! access to the forks (mutual exclusion), help to prevent deadlock in the dining
//! philosophers problem. By ensuring that at least one of the necessary conditions
//! for deadlock cannot occur, the system is made deadlock-free. 
//! 

/*
* The dining philosophers problem involves multiple threads needing
* synchronized access to shared resources, risking deadlock.
*
* This code models philosophers as threads and forks as shared Mutex<()>
* wrapped in Arc for thread-safe reference counting.
*
* To prevent deadlock from a "deadly embrace" of waiting for neighboring
* forks, philosophers acquire lower numbered forks first. This breaks
* symmetry and avoids circular waiting.
*
* The Mutexes provide exclusive fork access. The Arc allows sharing forks
* between philosophers.
*
* The simulation prints start time, eating duration, and total time for
* all philosophers. Total time approximately equals philosophers divided
* by forks, as that number can eat concurrently.
*
* Key techniques:
* - Used Mutex<()> to represent exclusive fork access
* - Wrapped in Arc to share Mutexes between threads
* - Numbered philosophers and acquire lower fork first
* - Prints timing metrics for simulation
