//! Reflection Questions:
//!
//! # How does Rust's ownership model improve security compared to a garbage collected language like Python?
//!
//! Rust's ownership model contributes to security in several ways that are
//! distinct from garbage-collected languages like Python:
//!
//! - **Memory Safety**: Rust's strict ownership rules prevent common memory
//!   safety errors such as buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, and
//!   use-after-free vulnerabilities, which are potential attack vectors in
//!   systems programming.
//!
//! - **Data Races**: The borrowing rules in Rust prevent data races by ensuring
//!   that mutable references are exclusive. Concurrent programming is safer,
//!   reducing the risk of race conditions that could be exploited.
//!
//! - **No Undefined Behavior**: In Rust, the compiler guarantees that safe code
//!   does not result in undefined behavior, which is a common source of security
//!   issues in languages that allow direct memory manipulation.
//!
//! - **Explicit Resource Management**: Resources like files and network sockets
//!   are automatically and predictably released when no longer in use, which
//!   prevents resource exhaustion attacks.
//!
//! - **Reduced Attack Surface**: By removing the need for manual memory
//!   management, Rust reduces the attack surface area, as developers are less
//!   likely to introduce security vulnerabilities through incorrect resource
//!   handling.
//!
//! - **Dependency on Fewer Runtime Guarantees**: Rust programs do not rely on
//!   runtime guarantees provided by a garbage collector, which can sometimes
//!   introduce security vulnerabilities if the runtime itself is compromised.
//!
//! - **Compile-Time Checks**: Many potential security issues are caught at
//!   compile time in Rust, long before code is deployed to production.
//!
//! While Python provides safety through high-level abstractions and its runtime,
//! Rust's compile-time ownership model offers a more granular level of control
//! and security guarantees, which is particularly important in systems-level
//! work where performance and security are critical.
//! 
//! # Why does immutability by default make Rust more secure?
//!
//! Immutability by default is a key aspect of Rust's design that contributes to
//! its security posture in the following ways:
//!
//! - **Predictable State**: Immutable data ensures that state does not change
//!   unexpectedly, which can prevent bugs and vulnerabilities related to state
//!   corruption or unintended side effects.
//!
//! - **Thread Safety**: Immutable data is inherently thread-safe, as there are
//!   no concurrent modifications to worry about. This eliminates a whole class
//!   of concurrency-related vulnerabilities.
//!
//! - **Reduced Complexity**: Code that uses immutable data is often simpler and
//!   easier to reason about. Less complexity means fewer opportunities for
//!   security flaws to arise.
//!
//! - **Controlled Mutability**: When mutability is required, Rust enforces it
//!   to be explicitly declared. This makes it easy to identify and audit code
//!   paths that could potentially lead to unsafe state changes.
//!
//! - **Prevention of Race Conditions**: Since mutable access to data requires
//!   explicit handling, Rust's type system prevents race conditions, which can
//!   be exploited if present in software.
//!
//! By promoting immutability, Rust encourages patterns that lead to safer and
//! more reliable code, which is less prone to security vulnerabilities that stem
//! from mutable state.
//! 
//! # What problems can be caused by allowing more access permissions than
//! necessary?
//!
//! Allowing more access permissions than necessary can lead to a range of
//! problems in software development, some of which include:
//!
//! - **Increased Security Risks**: Overly permissive access to resources like
//!   files, memory, or network interfaces can be exploited by malicious actors,
//!   leading to security breaches.
//!
//! - **Violation of Encapsulation**: It can break encapsulation by exposing
//!   internal state or implementation details that should be hidden, leading to
//!   tighter coupling and less maintainable code.
//!
//! - **Unintended Side Effects**: When code has more permissions than it needs,
//!   it can modify state in unexpected ways, resulting in bugs that are
//!   difficult to trace and fix.
//!
//! - **Principle of Least Privilege Violation**: This fundamental security
//!   principle states that a subject should only have the permissions necessary
//!   to perform its tasks. Violating this principle can lead to an increased
//!   attack surface.
//!
//! - **Harder Auditing and Review**: More permissions mean more paths to audit
//!   for potential issues, increasing the complexity and effort required to
//!   review code.
//!
//! - **Difficulty in Refactoring**: Having more permissions than necessary may
//!   indicate unclear boundaries of responsibility in the code, making
//!   refactoring and testing more challenging.
//!
//! Adhering to the principle of least privilege and carefully considering the
//! required access permissions can mitigate these risks, resulting in safer and
//! more robust software.
//! 
//! # How can using threads lead to safety issues if not properly coordinated?
//!
//! Using threads without proper coordination can introduce several safety issues
//! into a software system:
//!
//! - **Data Races**: Concurrent access to shared data without synchronization
//!   can result in data races where multiple threads read and write to the same
//!   location, leading to undefined behavior and corrupted data.
//!
//! - **Deadlocks**: Incorrectly acquiring locks or other synchronization
//!   primitives in an inconsistent order across multiple threads can lead to
//!   deadlocks, where threads block each other indefinitely, halting program
//!   execution.
//!
//! - **Livelocks**: Threads might continuously change their states in response
//!   to other threads without making any progress, similar to a deadlock but
//!   with constant activity.
//!
//! - **Starvation**: Threads may be indefinitely postponed if other threads
//!   continuously take priority, leading to starvation where some threads never
//!   get to execute their critical sections.
//!
//! - **Race Conditions**: Incorrect handling of the timing of events can lead to
//!   race conditions, where the system's behavior depends on the sequence or
//!   timing of uncontrollable events.
//!
//! - **Resource Leaks**: Failure to release resources such as memory, file
//!   descriptors, or locks due to thread termination or synchronization issues
//!   can cause resource leaks.
//!
//! - **Atomicity Violations**: When a sequence of operations that should be
//!   executed atomically is interrupted, it can leave the system in an invalid
//!   state.
//!
//! Proper coordination through synchronization mechanisms, attention to locking
//! strategies, and the use of Rust's concurrency-safe features can mitigate these
//! issues, ensuring that multi-threaded programs remain safe and reliable.
