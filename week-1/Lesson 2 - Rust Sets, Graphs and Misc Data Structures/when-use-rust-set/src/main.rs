//! # Critical Differences Between Vec, VecDeque, and LinkedList in Rust
//!
//! - `Vec`: It is a contiguous block of memory that allows random access to elements in constant time. This
//!   makes it efficient for accessing elements by index and for iterating over the elements in sequence. It
//!   is also efficient in terms of memory usage, as it stores elements in a single contiguous block. Use `Vec`
//!   when random access to elements or efficient iteration is a primary concern, and when memory usage needs to
//!   be optimized.
//!
//! - `VecDeque`: It is a double-ended queue implemented with a growable ring buffer. It provides O(1) time
//!   complexity for push and pop operations at both ends of the deque, making it suitable for use cases where
//!   elements need to be efficiently added or removed from the front and back of the collection.
//!
//! - `LinkedList`: It is a series of elements, where each element contains a value and a reference to the
//!   next element in the sequence. This allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements at any position
//!   in the list, as it only requires updating the references to neighboring elements. Use `LinkedList` when
//!   frequent insertion and deletion of elements at arbitrary positions is a primary concern.
//!
//! Each of these data structures has its own trade-offs and performance characteristics, so the choice of
//! which one to use depends on the specific requirements of the use case.
//!
//! # How does the performance of HashMap and BTreeMap differ for operations like insertion and lookup, according to the docs?
//!
//! According to the Rust documentation:
//!
//! - `HashMap`: It is implemented as a hash table and provides O(1) time complexity for insertion, deletion,
//!   and lookup on average, making it suitable for use cases where fast insertion and lookup are important.
//!
//! - `BTreeMap`: It is implemented as a balanced binary search tree and provides O(log n) time complexity for
//!   insertion, deletion, and lookup, making it suitable for use cases where the data needs to be stored in
//!   sorted order and the performance characteristics of a balanced binary search tree are beneficial.
//!
//! The choice between `HashMap` and `BTreeMap` depends on the specific requirements of the use case, such as
//! the need for fast insertion and lookup versus the need for sorted order and the performance characteristics
//! of a balanced binary search tree.
//!
//! # What role do iterators play in manipulating Rust collections? What iterator methods seem most useful?
//!
//! In Rust, iterators play a crucial role in manipulating collections by providing a way to process each
//! element of a collection in turn. They enable functional programming-style operations such as mapping,
//! filtering, and folding over the elements of a collection.
//!
//! Some of the most useful iterator methods in Rust include:
//! - `map`: Transforms each element of an iterator into another element by applying a function.
//! - `filter`: Selects only the elements of an iterator that satisfy a predicate.
//! - `fold`: Reduces the elements of an iterator into a single value by applying an accumulator function.
//! - `flat_map`: Transforms each element of an iterator into an iterator and flattens the resulting iterators
//!   into a single iterator.
//! - `collect`: Consumes an iterator and collects the elements into a specified data structure.
//!
//! These iterator methods provide powerful and expressive ways to manipulate Rust collections and perform
//! various transformations on the elements.
//!
//! # When can using entry API methods like or_insert optimize accumulators and maps? What problem does it help solve?
//!
//! Using entry API methods like `or_insert` can optimize accumulators and maps when there is a need to insert
//! a new value into a map if it doesn't already exist, and then return a mutable reference to the inserted or
//! existing value. This pattern is particularly useful for implementing efficient accumulator patterns where the
//! map is used to accumulate values associated with specific keys.
//!
//! The `or_insert` method helps solve the problem of efficiently inserting a new value into a map if the key
//! doesn't already exist, and obtaining a mutable reference to the inserted or existing value in a single
//! operation. It reduces the need for separate lookups and conditional inserts, resulting in more concise and
//! efficient code for accumulator and map-based operations.
//!
//! # What are some ways to manage capacity and prevent unnecessary allocations with Rust collections?
//!
//! In Rust, there are several ways to manage capacity and prevent unnecessary allocations with collections:
//!
//! - Using the `with_capacity` method: This method allows pre-allocating capacity for a collection based on an
//!   expected size, which can help prevent frequent re-allocations and improve performance.
//!
//! - Reusing and resizing collections: Instead of creating new collections for each operation, reusing and
//!   resizing existing collections can reduce unnecessary allocations and deallocations.
//!
//! - Employing the `reserve` method: For collections that support it, the `reserve` method can be used to
//!   pre-allocate additional capacity, reducing the need for frequent re-allocations during subsequent
//!   insertions.
//!
//! - Using specialized collections: Rust provides specialized collections such as `VecDeque` for double-ended
//!   queues and `HashMap` for hash maps, which can offer more efficient memory management for specific use
//!   cases.
//!
//! By employing these techniques, developers can effectively manage capacity and minimize unnecessary
//! allocations when working with Rust collections.
