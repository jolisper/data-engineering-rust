//! # Reflection Questions:
//!
//! ## When would you use a graph over another data structure?
//!
//! Choosing to use a graph data structure over other data structures like
//! arrays, linked lists, trees, or hash tables, depends on the nature of the
//! problem you're trying to solve. Here are some scenarios where a graph would
//! be the preferred choice:
//!
//! - **Modeling Networks**: Graphs are ideal for representing and analyzing
//!   networks, such as social networks, computer networks, and telecommunication
//!   networks, where the interconnections between nodes are crucial.

//! 
//! ## What limitations exist when detecting communities algorithmically?
//!
//! Detecting communities within networks is a common task in data analysis,
//! particularly in social networks, biological networks, and information
//! networks. While numerous algorithms have been developed for community
//! detection, each with its strengths, several inherent limitations affect
//! their effectiveness and applicability. These limitations include:
//!
//! - **Resolution Limit**: Some algorithms may fail to detect smaller
//!   communities within large networks due to a resolution limit, where the
//!   granularity of the detected communities is constrained by the size of the
//!   network and the algorithm's design.
//!
//! - **Scalability**: Large-scale networks, such as social media networks,
//!   pose computational challenges. Algorithms that perform well on small to
//!   medium-sized networks might not scale efficiently, leading to prohibitive
//!   computational costs.
//!
//! - **Dynamic Networks**: Many real-world networks are dynamic, with
//!   edges and nodes constantly changing over time. Static community detection
//!   algorithms struggle to accurately model and predict community structures
//!   in such evolving networks.
//!
//! - **Overlapping Communities**: In many networks, communities are not
//!   mutually exclusive, and nodes can belong to multiple communities.
//!   Algorithms that enforce strict partitions may fail to capture the
//!   complexity of overlapping community structures.
//!
//! - **Subjectivity of Community Definitions**: The definition of what
//!   constitutes a community can vary depending on the context and the
//!   specific characteristics of the network. This subjectivity can lead to
//!   different algorithms identifying different community structures in the
//!   same network, based on how they define and measure community quality.
//!
//! - **Noise and Missing Data**: Real-world data is often noisy or incomplete,
//!   which can significantly impact the accuracy of community detection
//!   algorithms. Algorithms must be robust to such imperfections to be
//!   effective in practical applications.
//!
//! Addressing these limitations requires a careful choice of algorithms,
//! considering the specific characteristics and requirements of the network
//! and the analysis objectives. In some cases, combining multiple algorithms
//! or incorporating domain-specific knowledge can improve community detection
//! outcomes.
//! 
//! ## How could graphs add value in your specific domain?
